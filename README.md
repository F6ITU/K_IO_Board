This I/O board is part of a set consisting of a 400 W LDMos based RF power amplifier (Munin 400), 
a medium power (600 or 1500 W) Zolotarev low pass filter, an Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU) nickname « Aries » 
and a 4 port antenna switch.

All these developments are the work and intellectual property of Kjell Karlsen LA2NI and Laurence Barker G8NJJ.

The I/O board ensures the physical link between the transceiver and the "Munin400/Aries" RF system
